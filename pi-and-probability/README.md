# Finding pi throwing rocks - is it possible???
Of course! And this program will show you how.

## What is the goal?
The goal of this program is to calculate the probability of a rock to fall in the bucket area (picture below), and from this number to calculate the area of the circle. Rember that the result will change every time you will execute the program, and the more rocks you throw the more accurate will be the result (by default 1 billion rocks) 

## How does this program works?
First, look at this picture.

Then imagine to throw a rock in the circonference. What is the probility of the rock to go in the 'bucket' area? Well, the `rock()` function will do it for us and will return 1 if the rock falls in the bucket, 0 if not. Then the `bucket()` function will count how many "ones" have been returned and, at last but not least, the `area()` function will print the area of the circle. Execute the program and you will discover how much is it!

## Conclusion
In conclusion, you have learned how to empirically calculate pi using probability. Thanks!
(Now also the c++ program)
